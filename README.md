This space is dedicated for my current Leetcode progression, I like to keep track of every challenge that I overcome and I will do my best to go back, review my code and refactor with new and more efficient things that i've learned.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript"/>

Everyday, the first thing I do is solve a Leetcode! 

## Optimizations

I'm constantly reviewing my Leetcode to see if there is a better way to approach every problem to make it more readable, efficient, or even shorter.  

## Lessons Learned:

The Biggest Lesson I learned in tackling this endless supply of questions is understanding that there is a long way to go. Not being able to answer a question is okay, as long as you take the initiative to improve.

This is a great motivation to keep learning and not feel discouraged, because even though you feel like you're not making progress or learning much, you are.
